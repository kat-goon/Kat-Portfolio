                The posters tell the story of the United States from
                1960 to the mid-70s where counterculture -- a movement that advocated for individuality in society and
                conformity where people adhered to the "American Dream." While researching, I came to the realization
                that both parties, in their own way, are fighting for their futures. This duality yet contrast in ideals
                made me think of the present. Focusing on the activism aspect of conformity
                and counterculture, I aimed to incite critical thought into the viewers. While they take
                in the information presented, I want their final sentiment to be “Was the American
                dream the ‘right’ way to live?” and “How much has changed since then?”

                With the final products I made, I wanted to tell the story of the United States from
                1960 to the mid-70s and how people had two ways of life and showed contrast
                and duality in all the assignments. Focusing on the activism aspect of conformity
                and counterculture, I aimed to incite critical thought into the viewers. While they take
