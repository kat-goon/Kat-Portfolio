            <h3>An experience between universities globally</h3>
            <h2>International Collaboration</h2>
            <p>
                In my last year at OCAD University, I had the opportunity to join the International Collaboration
                Network. A
                program which covers two semesters and accumulates into an exhibition at a select university. I had the
                privilege to work with students from universities in Germany, Finland, Mexico, and Japan on various
                projects.

            <h3>Main Project</h3>
            <h2>Expression in a Noisy World</h2>
            <p>
                The main project I worked on was a collaborative animation called “Expression in a Noisy World.” Through
                various Zoom calls, we found that we all have a shared interest in animation and were curious about what
                drives artists to express and create work. Through weekly meetings and setting goals, we were able to
                complete an animated collage that expresses our individual voices yet adds to a broader conversation on
                the
                art world.

            <h2>Forming connections across the continent</h2>
            <p>
                The Winter semester fostered a collaboration between students in Mexico and Canada. For the duration of
                this
                project, we worked together to create collage portraits that capture the essence of who we are.
