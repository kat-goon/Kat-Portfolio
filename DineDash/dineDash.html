            <p>
                Plastic use has become a rising topic through the lens of climate change and environmental
                sustainability, with Governments becoming increasingly involved in regulating the use of plastic
                utensils. Yet single plastic use is still extremely high and is still more popular than environmentally
                friendly options.

            <p>
                Before the COVID-19 Pandemic, Yorkdale Mall, located in Toronto, Canada, had a program in its food court
                where reusable cutlery tableware were used. The mall even had a program that specifically sorted its
                waste which significantly reduced the amount at the end of the day. Fast forward to 2024, Yorkdale has
                reverted to letting the vendors use the tableware of their choice. Inspired by this, we wanted to
                investigate the difference in use of plastic versus wooden utensils.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gathering the data ourselves, our goal was to see the relationship of consumer habits along with options
                provided by vendors in the food court. This information matters as it’s important to understand the
                implications plastic use has and how although one fork may seem insignificant, when compounded the
                effects are greater. We found an importance in the offerings of utensils as it goes to show why
                consumers are using certain materials.
