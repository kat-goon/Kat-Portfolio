                Hello there!
            </h1>

            <p>
                I’m Katherine - a designer based in Toronto, ON. and a recent graduate from OCAD
                University with a major in Graphic Design and a minor in Photography.
                <br>
                <br>
                Empathy, Collaboration, and storytelling are the core of my design practice. Love for being
                involved, building community, connecting with people builds empathy. Collaboration - always open to new
                ideas and feedback. Storytelling - how to interact and leaving a message that resonates with the user.
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm a strong believer in collaboration, resolved art and design is created in an iterative and shared
                space. Recently, I had the opportunity to participate in an international collaboration that accumulated
                into an <a href="../INTAC/intac.html">exhibit at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan!</a>

        <h3>An experience between universities globally</h3>
        <h2>International Collaboration</h2>
        <p>
            In my last year at OCAD University, I had the opportunity to join the International Collaboration Network. A
            program which covers two semesters and accumulates into an exhibition at a select university. I had the
            privilege to work with students from universities in Germany, Finland, Mexico, and Japan on various
            projects.

        <h3>Main Project</h3>
        <h2>Expression in a Noisy World</h2>
        <p>
            The main project I worked on was a collaborative animation called “Expression in a Noisy World.” Through
            various Zoom calls, we found that we all have a shared interest in animation and were curious about what
            drives artists to express and create work. Through weekly meetings and setting goals, we were able to
            complete an animated collage that expresses our individual voices yet adds to a broader conversation on the
            art world.

        <h3>MexiCanada</h3>
        <h2>Forming connections across the continent</h2>
        <p>
            The Winter semester fostered a collaboration between students in Mexico and Canada. For the duration of this
            project, we worked together to create collage portraits that capture the essence of who we are.

            Made in collaboration with Gigliola Durante, Gustavo Antunez, and Ashley Kim
